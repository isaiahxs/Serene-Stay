FEATURES

---------------------------------------------------
SPOTS

Info:
roadmap says first feature we should work on is Spots which will appear on the landing page.

Navigating to the root URL will show us a list of all the spots.

Responsive layout: adjusting columns as browser is resized
    Min: 1 column
    Max: 4 columns

under the image boxes, we will have city, state, price and star value to the side

click anywhere on a spot tile to go to a spot details

CSS notes:
show pointer cursor on hover of clickable elements such as: logo, buttons, spot tiles

show a tooltip on hover over a spot tile. name of spot is in tooltip's text

Process/procedure:

- create folder in components for the spots that will contain an index.js file as well as a CSS file we will link to the index

- in the store folder, create spots.js like we did for session.js
    here we will have the POJO action creators as well as thunk action creators that will hit the desired backend route

    after the response from the AJAX call comes back, parse the JSON body of the response

    dispatch the action

- create a reducer for the spots

- insert the reducer for spot in the rootReducer in src/store/index.js

- wireframe shows we'll also have to have the star/review ratings (probably in the same div container as the city, state, and price.)
