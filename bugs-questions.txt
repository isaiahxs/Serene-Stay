2. in front end App.js, what is isLoaded and why is it T/F, and why does it affect my code

3. shouldn't a user be able to see login and signup if they're not signed in?

4. on SignupFormPage, when i comment out the redirection to '/' if you're a session user, i am then able to access /signup, but i'm getting an error popup of "passwords do not match" even though they do
    EDIT THIS WAS POSSIBLY FIXED BECAUSE OF setConfirmPassword vs confirmPassword difference

5. i should be getting an error when i put in an invalid email address (doesn't have the @)

6. 304 when i go to / route. is that normal?

7. localhost:3000 after logging out only shows Home button and console shows 401 unauthorized, but if i sign in, then sign out, i'm able to see Log in and Sign up buttons

8. big big error when trying to sign up with bad data

9. on sign up, how to get createdAt updatedAt
