am i supposed to change something for serving the static assets in the frontend's build folder? it seems we have public instead of build


when i'm a signed in user posting a review on a spot i have not reviewed before, the User firstName and User lastName do not render immediately. a 'quick fix' is to add reviewArray or reviewState in the dependency array of the useEffect, but it causes my app to make a million calls per second.


owner of a spot should not be able to post a review on their own location.


need to update my seeder bulk deletes Op in things later


SOLVED:
when i'm on spot details page and i sign out, i'm getting this error:
ERROR
Cannot read properties of null (reading 'id')
TypeError: Cannot read properties of null (reading 'id')

cannot visit a spot right now without being logged in. might have something to do with sessionUser

- reason was i was trying to access 'id' of sessionUser which is null when there is no signed in user. to fix this, i had to add a check to ensure sessionUser was not null before trying to access its properties.
    -in the submitHandler, i updated userId to be userId: sessionUser?.id
    -in editSubmitHandler, i updated it as well to be userId: sessionUser?.id
    -then before rendering the reviews and edit/delete buttons, i updated the condition to check if 'sessionUser' existed before comparing the id's
