1. on sign up, getting undefined user on next state, but after a refresh, it appears just fine

2. in front end App.js, what is isLoaded and why is it T/F, and why does it affect my code

3. shouldn't a user be able to see login and signup if they're not signed in?

4. on SignupFormPage, when i comment out the rediretction to '/' if you're a session user, i am then able to access /signup, but i'm getting an error popup of "passwords do not match" even though they do
    EDIT THIS WAS POSSIBLY FIXED BECAUSE OF setConfirmPassword vs confirmPassword difference

5. i should be getting an error when i put in an invalid email address (doesn't have the @)
